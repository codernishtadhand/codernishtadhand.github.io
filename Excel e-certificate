# E-Certificate of M.S. Excel Online Course
Online courses have always helped an individual to learn many new things at home without going anywhere. M.S. Excel Courses is also that kind of course which will definately help an individual with his work. This course has been helpful for me as I could learn excel more deeply and know the short and tricks to make the data and manage the data easily online. Through this course i can be independent of solving each equation or arithmetic operation on notebook and directly do it in the app itself. I learned many shortcut keys to insert tools in excel like to insert table the short cut key is ctrl+T and many more. I also got to know what cell is, how I can change the format of cell, what is sheet, string etc. now I am open to us my laptops to store data without any kind of hesitation.
